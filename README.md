# ITCS381 (MUICT) Introduction to multimedia
## Intro2Multimedia_project_1

This is an intro to multimedia class assignmet. <br>
I'm just messing with basic openCV tools and some other basic python tools.

The original picture I work is called `picture.jpg`. <br>
The transformed image is called `picture_transformed.jpg`. <br>
In case you want to know which technique is used on what part, take a look at `picture_transformed_text.jpg`.

Enjoy! :D
